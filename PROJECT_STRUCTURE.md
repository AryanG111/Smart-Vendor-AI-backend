## Detailed File Descriptions

### Root Directory
*   **`run.py`**: The script you execute to run the server. It imports the app factory and calls `app.run()`.
*   **`.env`**: Stores sensitive information like database connection strings and API keys. This file is not committed to version control.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Generated by `pip freeze`, this file lists all libraries needed to run the project.

### App Directory (`app/`)
*   **`__init__.py`**: The heart of the application. It contains the `create_app()` function which sets up the Flask instance, initializes the database, and registers the routes (blueprints).
*   **`config.py`**: Contains the `Config` class which loads environment variables and sets up the SQLAlchemy database URI.
*   **`extensions.py`**: A central place to initialize Flask extensions like `db = SQLAlchemy()`. This avoids circular import issues.

### Models (`app/models/`)
*   **`vendor.py`**: Represents the vendor entity. Contains fields like name, contact info, category, and the vector embedding for AI search.
*   **`performance.py`**: Stores historical performance data for vendors, such as on-time delivery rates and quality scores.
*   **`feedback.py`**: Stores user feedback and ratings for vendors.

### Routes (`app/routes/`)
*   **`vendor_routes.py`**: Contains the actual API endpoints (e.g., `POST /vendors`, `POST /vendors/recommend`). It receives HTTP requests, calls the appropriate services, and returns JSON responses.

### Services (`app/services/`)
*   **`ai_service.py`**: Wraps the logic for interacting with AI models (e.g., Google Gemini or OpenAI) to generate text embeddings for vendor descriptions.
*   **`recommendation_service.py`**: Contains the core business logic for finding the best vendors. It uses the embeddings from `ai_service` to perform similarity searches in the database.

### Utilities (`app/utils/`)
*   **`auth.py`**: Contains helper functions for handling user authentication, such as verifying API tokens or passwords.
